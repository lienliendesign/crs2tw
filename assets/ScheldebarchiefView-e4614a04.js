The Schelde's pristine waters provided a crucial ingredient for beer production, as the boiling process during brewing effectively sterilized the water, making it safe to consume. This practice not only gave rise to the region's rich brewing traditions but also ensured that people had a relatively safe beverage option during a time when clean drinking water was scarce.

Through diligent research and innovative thinking, she implemented a rigorous filtration process to purify the river water, removing the harmful PFOS compounds. This innovative approach not only showcased her commitment to sustainable practices but also represented a testament to the resilience of individuals in the face of environmental challenges. By successfully brewing beer with revitalized Schelde River water, Lien not only highlighted the importance of addressing pollution but also celebrated the spirit of creative problem-solving in the quest for a better, more sustainable world.
